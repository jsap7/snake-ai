# Snake AI

An AI that plays Google's Snake Game using browser automation and computer vision.

## Overview
This project implements an AI agent that can play the Google Snake Game autonomously. It uses browser automation, computer vision, and pathfinding algorithms to achieve high scores consistently.

## Features (Planned)
- Automated game initialization
- Real-time game state detection
- Intelligent pathfinding
- Advanced survival strategies
- Performance monitoring and analytics

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Selenium/Playwright for browser automation
- OpenCV/PIL for computer vision
- Custom pathfinding algorithms

## Setup
(Setup instructions will be added as development progresses)

## Development

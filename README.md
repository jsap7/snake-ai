# Snake AI

An AI that plays Google's Snake Game using browser automation and computer vision.

## Overview
This project implements an AI agent that can play the Google Snake Game autonomously. It uses browser automation, computer vision, and pathfinding algorithms to achieve high scores consistently.

## Features (Planned)
- Automated game initialization
- Real-time game state detection
- Intelligent pathfinding
- Advanced survival strategies
- Performance monitoring and analytics

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Selenium/Playwright for browser automation
- OpenCV/PIL for computer vision
- Custom pathfinding algorithms

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jsap7/snake-ai.git
cd snake-ai
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the script:
```bash
python src/main.py
```

## Development

- The `browser.py` file contains the `GameController` class that handles browser automation
- The `main.py` file contains the test script for the game controller
